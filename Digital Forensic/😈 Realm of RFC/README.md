## Description
I was playing with my favorite sniffer tool and I noticed that one of the employee had accessed malware in their local system. It looked like he also is **BANNED** from a server which follows this RFC rule(https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1459) , can you find the employees username?
If youve found him, wrap the username as your flag!
For example: username = ampunbangjago
then, Your flag is `LKSPJKT{ampunbangjago}`
